# Budget Tracker ðŸ“ˆ

Budget Tracker is a lightweight MongoDB-powered website to see a graph on how you're spending, or making money.


## Quirks ðŸŽ¯

The website will load the transactions regardless of internet connection.

If the website goes offline and a transaction is input, it'll upload it to the server once connection is restored.
